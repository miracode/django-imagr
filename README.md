Imagr allows users to create an account and upload photos.  

They can follow others and see their photos in recent streams.

Users can create albums and add their photos and cover-photo of their choice.

This app is implemented with Django and is designed for deployment on an AWS server.

This was a project for the Python Dev Accelerator at Code Fellows in collaboration with Jason Brokaw
